# If it performs log n steps → O(log n)
# Need sorted List
# Find the most effecient way to get a number in a sorted list(1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8)
# The logarithmic Big O is flat on a graph
# It is also far more efficient than O(n^2) and O(n)

         ## In addition:

# If the algorithm perform log n steps, it is written as O(log n): 
# If the algorithm perfom log n steps, each step cuts the problem size in half
#        Eg: Binary search 


         ## in addition

# O(n log n) is the most effecient when sorting algorthms especially when sorting strings
