# BIG O

- Comparing two sets of code
- Check how effecient they can run


Big O include two types:
- Time Complexity : Measures how number of operations increases when input sizes increases
- Space Complexity : How much memory a certain code occupy


Hint: A code may run faster than another but take huge space
      A code may run slow and take small space

Data Structure include: Array, Stack, Queue, Singly-Linked List, Doubly-Linked List, Skip List, Hash Table, Binary Search Tree, Cartesian Tree, B-Tree, Red-Black Tree, Splay Tree, AVL Tree, KD Tree

Algorithm INlcude: QuickSort, Mergesort, Timesort, Heapsort, Bubble sort, Insertion sort, selection sort, Tree sort, Shell sort, Bucket sort, Radix sort, Counting sort, Cubesort

Big(O) summary:

- O(n^2) = Loop within a loop
- O(n) = Proportional
- O(log n) = Divide and conquer
- O(1) = Constant

# CLASSES

- Analogy: class can be referred to as Cookie Creater
_ To be able to make a cookie, you need something that will be the base for all cookie: Constructure

# POINTERS

- Nodes in the Linkedlist operates pretty much like dictionary
- The variables will continue to point to the same node even though the value at the node has been changed
- Once a value has no variable pointing to it, it is removed by python in the process called "Garbage collection"
