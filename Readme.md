# BIG O

- Comparing two sets of code
- Check how effecient they can run


Big O include two types:
- Time Complexity : Measures how number of operations increases when input sizes increases
- Space Complexity : How much memory a certain code occupy


Hint: A code may run faster than another but take huge space
      A code may run slow and take small space
